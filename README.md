# Starship-Salvage
Semester 2 DADP and GDII game

HI! Welcome to Starship Salvage

Please note, this game works with Keyboard and Controller, HOWEVER, navigating the cursor and selecting using controller does not work as of yet so please have a mouse handy for ingame situations!

The game prototype ends once youve repaired the ship to 1/3!

P.S. We hate Zorb. We listened to his sob story about his Blankie over 50 times.
