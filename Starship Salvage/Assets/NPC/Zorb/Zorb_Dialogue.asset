  Lines:
  - "And there I didn\u2019t think I could get more stressed\u2026"
  - Hey, kid! Did no one teach you not to use Lu Signal towers as parking markers?
  - "It\u2019s completely busted! How am I meant to tell the region presidents about
    the festival now?!"
  - " I\u2019m so gonna get fired\u2026"
  - "You\u2019re SORRY?! Sorry doesn\u2019t save my butt from getting the sack, kid!"
  - "Tell you what. If you\u2019re so sorry, you can HAND DELIVER these flyers to
    each region president. "
  - Okay kid, you have no choice.
  - "You don\u2019t look properly equipped for the task though, so I suggest you
    start by visiting the Lu Ra president first. "
  - "He might be able to help you with what you\u2019ll need for the other regions."
  - 'Be quick, kid, the festival is in a few days... '
  - I CANNOT afford not to have the support of the presidents!
  - "Come back here when you\u2019re finished with your punishment!"
