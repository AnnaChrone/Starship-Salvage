  Lines:
  - "What do you want\u2026"
  - Flowers? I've never seen no flowers in Ra Lu, you think anything can grow here???
  - The closest thing we have to a flower is our regional plant, the XXX
  - They're pretty rare to find, considering they need a perfect Ra Lu climate to
    grow, but I'm sure you can find one if you try hard enough.
  - "They like to grow in the craters at the bases of the mountains of Ra Lu, so
    your best bet would be to start looking in each of those\u2026"
  - Good luck!
