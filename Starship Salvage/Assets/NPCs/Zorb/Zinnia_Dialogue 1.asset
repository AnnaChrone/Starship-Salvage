  - "Oh no\u2026 oh no, oh no, OH NO! What do you mean my order was cancelled!"
  - "I\u2019m meant to be supplying the flowers for the festival, but the company
    I was sourcing from got shut down by the CLPD for fraud!"
  - What? You can help me? I really hope you can.
  - "I\u2019d go myself, but I\u2019ve never left Co Lu before, so I have no idea
    where these flowers are located in each region."
  - "You\u2019ve visited all the regions already? That\u2019s awesome! Maybe you
    can help me after all."
  - Hopefully you have a better sense of direction than me!
  - "\u201CAs for finding the flowers, I\u2019m sure some locals in each region could
    point you in the right direction."
  - Good Luck!
  - Meet back here once you've collected all four types! Ill teach you how to make
    a bouquet :)
  - It doesn't look like you've found all flowers yet...
  - Come back here once youve found them all!
  - Oh look! You've found them all! Now, all you need to do is turn them into a bouquet!
  - It's very easy, just use this flower arranging table I have here! *trigger press
