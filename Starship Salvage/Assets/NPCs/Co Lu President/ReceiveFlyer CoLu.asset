  - My, my, a message for me from Min Lu!
  - "Well, I haven\u2019t heard from my cousin in ages!"
  - "If we\u2019ve been so cordially invited to this year\u2019s Lumies Festival,
    he must have put aside the Min Lu/Co Lu spat we had at the last one!"
  - I mean, how was I meant to know the Co Lu mushroom fields had been plagued by
    giggle bugs?
  - ' I will say that was the best laugh I have ever had!'
  - Anyhoo, you can send word back to my cousin that Co Lu gratefully accepts his
    invitation!
  - ' I will be sure to bring him a *special* gift.'
  - Nasty little critters! Once they get into a crop, the poor soul who eats the
    harvest laughs for days on end!
  - "Now imagine that when the entire planet of Lu is eating our traditional stew
    made of said crops\u2026 Such fun! "
  - My, but you have brought back good memories.
  - I think you deserve a helping hand for trekking all this way to deliver these
    flyers!
  - "As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve figured out by now, each region has their own unique
    indigenous fruit."
  - Over here in Co Lu, we have the marvellous Sizear fruit!
  - "One bite and you\u2019ll get big enough to make crossing the rivers and land
    much easier!"
  - Just find the glowing purple marsh crater in the middle of Co Lu.
  - Then go down to the bottom, where the Sizear fruit naturally grows!
  - Good luck, and I hope to see you at the festival.
  - "Oh, don\u2019t you fret about it. It\u2019s all good fun here!"
  - ' Now, I think you deserve a helping hand for trekking all this way to deliver
