  - You must be the poor soul who crashlanded right into the communication Tower!
  - "Zorb is still not very pleased about that\u2026"
  - You're looking for flowers? I thought Co Lu was covering those this year.
  - "Ah. CLPD. Makes sense. Horrible Lumies they are\u2026"
  - Fair enough! I'm not one to question other regions!
  - Well, if you need to find the XXX Flower, I'm sure there's a few growing in the
