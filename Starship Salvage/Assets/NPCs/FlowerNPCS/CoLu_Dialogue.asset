  Lines:
  - Oh, you're the one helping Zinnia find her flowers?
  - Such a shame the CLPD decided to do their jobs so close to the festival!
  - Anyhoo, Co Lus Flowers, XXX,  are very special, you see, they only grow in the
    Co Lu greenhouse in the sky!
  - Just look for the Co Lu greenhouse on stilts and you'll find a XXX in there!
  - ' I hope you''ve either found the Sizear or Aprella Fruits in order to reach
    the front door!'
