  - What is this?
  - An invite to the Lumies Festival, you say?
  - "My, my\u2026this is exciting!"
  - ' It has been ever so long since we united as Lumies for some good raucous fun!'
  - Well, you really have lightened our rather chilly mood here, my strange alien
    friend!
  - ' It really is hard to stay positive when your hot fruit tea keeps freezing. '
  - Speaking of fruit, as a way to say thank you for being the messenger to such
    delightful news, I want to tell you a Lu Lu secret!
  - 'Deep in the darkest part of the Lu Lu ice mines, there grows a mythical fruit
    whose ember glows forever: the Neonana fruit.'
  - If you eat it, you too will glow.
  - To find it, go down the tunnel that is not lit, for the glow fruit shall be the
    true light!
  - Fear not, when the Lumies of Lu Lu turn three, they eat the Neonana fruit as
    a way of being accepted into society.
  - I am sure you can face the dark like a three-year-old Lumie can.
  - But I must leave you now.
  - ' I have to go and have my fruit tea defrosted for the nineteenth time today. '
  - Perhaps I will see you again at the Lumies Festival. Good bye!
  - "Questioning our ancient fruits is feeble coming from someone who needs a spacesuit
    to survive here, don\u2019t you think?"
  - ' Unless you have any other silly questions you want to waste my time with, I
    have to go now and have my fruit tea defrosted for the nineteenth time today.'
  - Perhaps I will see you again at the Lumies Festival. Good bye!
