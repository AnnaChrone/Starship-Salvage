  Lines:
  - What brings you here?
  - "What\u2019s this? A flyer? Surely Min Lu has greater technological advancements
    than messenger\u2026aliens."
  - "Whatever. I wouldn\u2019t put it past my brother to use such archaic methods,
    ha ha!"
  - " I\u2019ve always been the better sibling\u2026 "
  - "So he\u2019s hosting the annual Lumies Festival, ay?"
  - "Let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll be able to pull it off this year, or if it\u2019ll
    go up in flames like last time!"
  - "Don\u2019t ask\u2026"
  - 'You need help with visiting the other regions? What are you, weak? '
  - I guess not every species can be all powerful like the Lumies.
  - "I can\u2019t help you much, but I can tell you about the ancient Aprella fruit
    kept in the temple on the highest peak of Ra Lu."
  - It will be quite the journey to get up there, though the descent should be much
    quicker!
  - "Just follow the path to the temple and you shouldn\u2019t get too lost\u2026"
  - "I just said don\u2019t ask! Are you aliens hard of hearing? "
  - "Hearing doesn\u2019t seem to be the only thing you people lack."
  - How do you even survive without being as powerful as us Lumies?
  - " I can\u2019t help you become a Lumie, but I can tell you about the ancient
    Aprella fruit kept in the temple on the highest peak of Ra Lu."
  - ' It will be quite the journey to get up there, though the descent should be
    much quicker!'
  - "Just follow the path to the temple and you shouldn\u2019t get too lost\u2026"
